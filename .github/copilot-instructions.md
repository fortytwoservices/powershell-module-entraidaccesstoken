This repository contains a central PowerShell module used by a lot of other PowerShell modules. This means that changes to this module can have a big impact on other modules and it is important to ensure that any changes are well-tested and do not introduce any breaking changes.

All PowerShell code in this repository should be compatible with PowerShell 7.1 or later, and should follow best practices for PowerShell development, including using proper naming conventions, commenting code, and writing unit tests where possible.

The module is published to powershellgallery.com, under the Fortytwo brand.
